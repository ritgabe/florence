            <h2>Milestone 1</h2>
            <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
            <p>
                There is currently no one, easy way to view adoptable pets in a 
                nearby location; a person looking to adopt must go through each 
                adoption siteâ€™s individual services to view or look into adopting 
                a pet. Additionally, there are many animals waiting to be adopted 
                due to lack of awareness from the population, this application may 
                provide more awareness to the issues of how many ownerless pets 
                there are.
            </p>

            <h3>Key Stakeholders</h3>
            <p>
                The end users that we aim to reach with our solution will ultimately 
                be the general population of people looking to adopt a new pet.
                However, we have identified that the key stakeholders in this context
                will be the pet shelters and breeders that are looking for the best 
                ways to connect stray animals to their new homes.
            </p>

            <h3>General Direction for a Solution</h3>
            <p>
                Using a rapid contextual inquiry methodology, we plan to interview
                and observe users in order to gain a greater understanding of the
                specific challenges involved when going through the pet adoption 
                process. Using a thorough series of ideations and prototyping, we will 
                design a digital solution that can expedite the pet adoption process
                and limit any existing pain points.
