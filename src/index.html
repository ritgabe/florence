      <h2>Milestone 1</h2>
      <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
      <p>
        There is currently no one, easy way to view adoptable pets in a nearby
        location; a person looking to adopt must go through each adoption site’s
        individual services to view or look into adopting a pet. Additionally,
        there are many animals waiting to be adopted due to lack of awareness
        from the population, this application may provide more awareness to the
        issues of how many ownerless pets there are.
      </p>

      <h3>Key Stakeholders</h3>
      <p>
        The end users that we aim to reach with our solution will ultimately be
        the general population of people looking to adopt a new pet. However, we
        have identified that the key stakeholders in this context will be the
        pet shelters and breeders that are looking for the best ways to connect
        stray animals to their new homes.
      </p>
      <p>
       The primary concern of these stakeholders is that they continue to find responsible and capable adopters for their pets. Additionally, they will likely want the ability to quickly make postings for newly available pets as well as make updates to existing ones. Since these pet shelters and breeders will be directly involved as admin users in the normal operation of the website, we plan to involve them in our contextual inquiry process as we design the application. We will also hold stakeholder meetings following the completion of each milestone in order to present the current state of the design and enable regular feedback. 
      </p>
      <p>During these meetings, and over the stakeholders’ preferred method of communication, we will be displaying designs of the applications through screenshots of wireframes or the application itself. Each design will be accompanied by a short explanation of how the design was formed or ideated. If ideas are brought up by the stakeholders, they will be taken into consideration as they are given; the team will discuss as a group on a per-idea basis. We will endeavour to establish an acceptable and clear rapport with stakeholders at the beginning of the project, which will include adapting our communication methods to suit what the stakeholders are comfortable with. Any worries brought up regarding design of the application will be discussed, and other worries of the stakeholders (such as pets being given to bad owners or too many pets in the shelter) should be addressed in the application design.</p>

      <h3>General Direction for a Solution</h3>
      <p>
        Using a rapid contextual inquiry methodology, we plan to interview and
        observe users in order to gain a greater understanding of the specific
        challenges involved when going through the pet adoption process. Using a
        thorough series of ideations and prototyping, we will design a digital
        solution that can expedite the pet adoption process and limit any
        existing pain points.
